#  Spring Boot Application Properties
Spring Boot Framework comes with a built-in mechanism for application configuration using a file called **application.properties**. It is located inside the *src/main/resources* folder.

Spring Boot provides various properties that can be configured in the application.properties file. The properties have default values. We can set a property(s) for the Spring Boot application. Spring Boot also allows us to define our own property if required.

The application.properties file allows us to run an application in a different environment. In short, we can use the application.properties file to:

- Configure the Spring Boot framework
- Define our application custom configuration properties

## YAML Properties File

Spring Boot provides another file to configure the properties is called yml file. The Yaml file works because the Snake YAML jar is present in the classpath. Instead of using the application.properties file, we can also use the application.yml file, but the Yml file should be present in the classpath.
