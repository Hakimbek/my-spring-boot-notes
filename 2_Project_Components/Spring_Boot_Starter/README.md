# Spring Boot Starters
Spring Boot provides a number of starters that allow us to add jars in the classpath. Spring Boot built-in starters make development easier and rapid. Spring Boot Starters are the dependency descriptors.

In the Spring Boot Framework, all the starters follow a similar naming pattern: spring-boot-starter-\*, where \* denotes a particular type of application. For example, if we want to use Spring and JPA for database access, we need to include the **spring-boot-starter-data-jpa** dependency in our pom.xml file of the project.

## Third-Party Starters
We can also include third party starters in our project. But we do not use **spring-boot-starter** for including third party dependency. The **spring-boot-starter** is reserved for official Spring Boot artifacts. The third-party starter starts with the name of the project. For example, the third-party project name is **abc**, then the dependency name will be **abc-spring-boot-starter**.

The Spring Boot Framework provides the following application starters under the **org.springframework.boot** group.
