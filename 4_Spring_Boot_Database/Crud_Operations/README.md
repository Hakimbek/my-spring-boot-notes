# Spring Boot CRUD Operations
## What is the CRUD operation?
The CRUD stands for **Create, Read/Retrieve, Update** and **Delete**. These are the four basic functions of the persistence storage.

The CRUD operation can be defined as user interface conventions that allow view, search and modify information through computer-based forms and reports. CRUD is data-oriented and the standardized use of HTTP action verbs. HTTP has a few important verbs.

### POST: Creates a new resource
### GET: Reads a resource
### PUT: Updates an existing resource
### DELETE: Deletes a resource

Within a database, each of these operations maps directly to a series of commands. However, their relationship with a **RESTful API** is slightly more complex.

## Standard CRUD Operation
CREATE Operation: It performs the INSERT statement to create a new record.
READ Operation: It reads table records based on the input parameter.
UPDATE Operation: It executes an update statement on the table. It is based on the input parameter.
DELETE Operation: It deletes a specified row in the table. It is also based on the input parameter.
How CRUD Operations Works
CRUD operations are at the foundation of the most dynamic websites. Therefore, we should differentiate CRUD from the HTTP action verbs.
